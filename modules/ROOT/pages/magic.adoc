Magic is software I wrote to make Microsoft Word a single sourcing tool. "Magic" stands for **Merge and Generate Integrated Content**. Magic published content in multiple file formats with a minimum of effort.

Magic could generate PDF, CHM, and HTML files directly from Microsoft Word documents. Content was managed in Word, using simple formatting and a minimum of styles. Magic could optionally generate HTML Help projects for RoboHelp, so that the user can export additional formats, such as WebHelp.

Magic played well with RoboHelp but it did not need RoboHelp to perform its functions. If Microsoft Help Workshop was installed, Magic could compile CHM files. It saved PDFs using Microsoft's PDF plug-in for Microsoft Word 2007. Magic hit the sweet spot between complexity and flexibility. I designed Magic to eliminate tedious aspects of technical writing. I used Magic as a standalone content management system, and in combination with authoring tools that were compatible with HTML Help project files.

The advantages of Magic were:

*   **Simplicity**. Content was formatted using standard word processing conventions. Since content was separated from presentation, minimal formatting was required.
*   **Convenience**. Generated files were production-ready and did not require tweaking.
*   **Power**. Documents could be edited, combined, and rearranged easily. Magic added single-sourcing features to Word, such as conditional text, document variables, and layouts that controlled the appearance of generated files. Magic validated source documents to detect formatting errors.
*   **Flexibility**. Content was stored in ubiquitous .doc files. Most business users have Word, and already knew how to edit documents or add comments. Magic made help authoring easier by building on existing skills.
Magic is not for sale, and I don't distribute it. I no longer maintain it for current versions of Word. I developed Magic to increase my productivity as a technical communicator. I mention it on this site since it was a useful authoring tool. I created hundreds of production deliverables with it. By the way, if you think Word sucks out of the box, I agree with you. And if you are using a current version of Word, I agree with you more.

I'm not an average Word user. To me, Word is a programmable document object model with a terrible user interface. Magic was fun and useful for a time. But this is not how I do things today.
