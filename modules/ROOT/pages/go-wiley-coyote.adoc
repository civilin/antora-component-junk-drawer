= Writers are coyotes

Successful writers have a lot in common with Wiley Coyote. Coyote is my kind of guy. He's *smart*. He's *technical*. He *learns fast*. He *never gives up*. Those are the attributes of successful writers and perhaps not coincidentally, hilarious cartoon characters.

.It's merely a matter of time, Mr. Road Runner!

When you've had a hard day writing, ask yourself:

* Did I fall thousands of feet today?

* Did I explode?

* Was I crushed by a boulder?

If you were crushed by a boulder, blown up, and fell so far the impact created a dust cloud, chances are you'll pick yourself up and try again tomorrow.

Writers are coyotes. It's what we do.
